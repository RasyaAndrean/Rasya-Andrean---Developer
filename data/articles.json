      "content": "# Building Scalable React Applications\n\nWhen building large React applications, proper architecture becomes crucial for maintainability and performance.\n\n## Component Architecture\n\nStart with a clear component hierarchy and follow the single responsibility principle. Each component should have one clear purpose.\n\n## State Management\n\nFor complex applications, consider using Redux or Zustand for global state management. Keep local state when possible.\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\nUse React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Implement code splitting with React.lazy for better loading times.",

      "content": "# Modern CSS Techniques for Better UX\n\nCSS has evolved significantly, offering powerful tools for creating better user experiences.\n\n## CSS Grid and Flexbox\n\nCombine Grid for layout and Flexbox for component alignment. Grid excels at two-dimensional layouts while Flexbox handles one-dimensional arrangements.\n\n## Custom Properties (CSS Variables)\n\nUse custom properties for theming and maintaining consistent design systems. They're perfect for dark/light mode implementations.\n\n## Container Queries\n\nContainer queries allow components to respond to their container size rather than viewport size, enabling truly modular responsive design.",

      "content": "# RESTful API Design Principles\n\nGood API design is crucial for developer experience and long-term maintainability.\n\n## Resource-Based URLs\n\nUse nouns for resources and HTTP methods for actions. `/users/123` is better than `/getUser?id=123`.\n\n## Consistent Response Format\n\nMaintain consistent response structures across all endpoints. Include metadata like pagination info and error details.\n\n## Proper HTTP Status Codes\n\nUse appropriate status codes: 200 for success, 201 for creation, 400 for client errors, 500 for server errors.\n\n## Versioning Strategy\n\nImplement API versioning from the start. Use URL versioning (`/v1/users`) or header-based versioning.",

Here's how I approached this complex project.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nI chose a microservices architecture with separate services for user management, product catalog, orders, and payments.\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n- Frontend: React with TypeScript\n- Backend: Node.js with Express\n- Database: MongoDB for flexibility\n- Payment: Stripe integration\n- Authentication: JWT tokens\n\n## Key Challenges\n\n### Payment Integration\n\nIntegrating Stripe required careful handling of webhooks and ensuring PCI compliance.\n\n### Inventory Management\n\nImplemented optimistic locking to handle concurrent inventory updates.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nStart with a monolith and extract services as needed. Premature optimization can lead to unnecessary complexity.",

      "content": "# JavaScript Performance Optimization Tips\n\nPerformance optimization is crucial for user experience. Here are practical tips for faster JavaScript.\n\n## Memory Management\n\nAvoid memory leaks by properly cleaning up event listeners and clearing references to DOM elements.\n\n## Efficient DOM Manipulation\n\nBatch DOM updates and use DocumentFragment for multiple insertions. Avoid layout thrashing by reading and writing DOM properties separately.\n\n## Algorithm Optimization\n\nChoose appropriate data structures. Use Map for key-value pairs and Set for unique values instead of arrays when appropriate.\n\n## Async Operations\n\nUse Promise.all() for parallel operations and implement proper error handling to prevent blocking.",
